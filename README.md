# Lox-interpreter
## Purpose
This repository shows my journey reading [*Crafting Interpreters*](https://craftinginterpreters.com/), by Robert Nystrom and implementing an interpreter for the Lox programming language in Java as he does it in the first part of his book, for educational purposes.

Usage of the Makefile :
```bash
$ make
